PROJECT TITLE:Fundamentals of Programming Assignment 1
PURPOSE OF PROJECT:This purpose ot this projcet is to gauge your proficiency in the following areas: 
• Analyse the execution of a programme or code segment to ascertain the code's outcome.
• Modify a current programme or piece of code to obtain the desired result.
• Use programming and algorithmic thinking skills to solve simple computational issues.

By creating a simple programme to calculate statistics of student grades. It will serve as proof of the knowledge gained from the unit's first two modules.
